# Describtion
This graduation project, developed under DEPI, focuses on the American stock market by collecting and processing extensive financial data spanning the past 20 years. The system will handle big data acquisition, filtering, cleaning, and detailed analysis of individual stocks. An advanced AI model will then be trained on this historical data to predict future stock prices, providing insights for potential market trends and investment strategies.
